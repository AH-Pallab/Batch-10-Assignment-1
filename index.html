            <h1>HTML</h1>
            <p>
              HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to
              create and structure content on the web, using elements like
              headings, paragraphs, links, and images. It forms the backbone of
              web pages, working alongside CSS and JavaScript to create fully
              functional websites.

            <h1>CSS</h1>
            <p>
              CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to
              describe the presentation of a document written in HTML, defining
              the visual appearance and layout of web pages. It allows for the
              separation of content and design, enabling more flexible and
              efficient web development.

            <p>
              JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language used to
              create dynamic and interactive elements on web pages. It enables
              functionalities such as form validation, animations, and
              asynchronous content updates, enhancing user experience and web
              application capabilities.
